- Work on more syntax/parsing
- Move the keyname replacements over to a yaml file...etc.

check these later

# TODO: read in the file, parse it line by line, use text_finder and extract away
# TODO: ensure if there are duplicate strings on one line, to handle that correctly? not sure if that's even a use-case?
# for eg: find_text("%a{'href' => 'http://whatever'} whatever"), ["whatever"]
# TODO: Do extraction, verify the haml is parsable at the end.
# TODO: handles duplicate texts and doesn't silently let that pass somehow
# TODO: does not fail on handling text with weird characters so t() fails weirdly ("hell's a ~@~" => t(".hell's_a_~@~"))...
