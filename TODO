- Work on more syntax/parsing
- Move the keyname replacements over to a yaml file...etc.
- Have an interactive mode: define workflow(s) for using this lib/tool.
- Ensure if there are duplicate strings on one line, to handle that correctly? not sure if that's even a use-case?
  - for eg: find_text("%a{'href' => 'http://whatever'} whatever"), ["whatever"]
- Remove the ex1.output ex1.i18n-extractor duplication. (or move to tmp dir)
- Add {} to disallowed characters
