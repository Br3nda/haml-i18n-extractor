## general todo's

- Remove the ex1.output ex1.i18n-extractor duplication. (or move to tmp dir):
    Move to test/tmp a-la the way workflow is working.
- Ensure that yaml file gets written to the right directory, and does a deep merge.
- Add {} to disallowed characters
- Add yaml fixtures and compare those
- handled email suffixes (foo.en.html.haml etc)
- admin/bla should be namespaced such as: en.admin.bla vs just en.bla in the yml file?
- add herbgobbler (ERB) and this to another more generalized repo for translating templates?
- Refactor tests: split out what is integration vs unit, too much coupling.

## workflow todo's

  make sure yaml keys are in one file

  either way when yaml is written, it should just write itself to config/locales/en.yml
  wether its one-off, or project mode.

  give user more context on line changes (like grep -C 4)
