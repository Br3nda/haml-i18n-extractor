- Have an interactive mode: define workflow(s) for using this lib/tool.

- Remove the ex1.output ex1.i18n-extractor duplication. (or move to tmp dir):
    Move to test/tmp a-la the way workflow is working.

- Ensure that yaml file gets written to the right directory, and does a deep merge.

- Add {} to disallowed characters
- Add yaml fixtures and compare those
- handled email suffixes (foo.en.html.haml etc)
- admin/bla should be namespaced such as: en.admin.bla vs just en.bla in the yml file?
- add to README 'it is idempotent...' :P

## chage the workflow to work per-line

   regarding overwriting or not:
     right now just leave be (tmp file). figure out later.
        pass in opts...
   cleanup workflow - keep around
     but no prompting, just handle a rails project dir.
     move any prompting in workflow into prompter.
   if the user says 'no' on a line, make sure to not replace it!
