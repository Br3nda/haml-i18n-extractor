## general todo's

- Remove the ex1.output ex1.i18n-extractor duplication. (or move to tmp dir):
    Move to test/tmp a-la the way workflow is working.
- Ensure that yaml file gets written to the right directory, and does a deep merge.
- Add {} to disallowed characters
- Add yaml fixtures and compare those
- handled email suffixes (foo.en.html.haml etc)
- admin/bla should be namespaced such as: en.admin.bla vs just en.bla in the yml file?
- add herbgobbler (ERB) and this to another more generalized repo for translating templates?
- Refactor tests: split out what is integration vs unit, too much coupling.

## workflow todo's

  cleanup workflow - keep around
    just handle a rails project dir  move any prompting in workflow into prompter.
  if the user says 'no' on a line, make sure to not replace it
    no extra yaml keys...
  make sure yaml keys are in one file and fall into config/locales properly.
  give user more context on line changes (like grep -C 4)
  also right now there is a bug where it asks for 'y' twice?
